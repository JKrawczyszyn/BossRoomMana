# Boss Room mana

Implementing mana aura skill in existing project forked from [Unity-Technologies/com.unity.multiplayer.samples.coop](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.multiplayer.samples.coop).

- Project was modified in Unity 2022.3.7f1.
- Added mana bars to players and UI. Starting mana is set to 0 to facilitate easy testing of mana regeneration.
- Added a regenerating mana aura skill for the mage class. It is toggleable and functions independently of other skills.
- I attempted to maintain the same coding style and minimize refactoring, but in my opinion, whole project requires a lot of work to make it more readable and extensible.
